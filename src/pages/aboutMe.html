		<p><i>"Close your eyes and tell me what you see..." The Line I swear by as an Event Coordinator.</i></p>

		<p>My name is Jessica Cabral, a young, creative and eye for detailed individual whose passion is to make peoples visions become a reality.</p>
		<p>From grade eight graduation to my best friends wedding I have always had an interest in the event world. Throughout high school I found myself volunteering and getting involved in student organizations such as the student council, dance club, yearbook and prom committee. Outside of school I continued to volunteer my time in the Portuguese Community planning events and fundraisers with a local youth group. </p>
		<p>I was then introduced to a company called Serendipity &amp Co. Inc. where I became an  intern for six months. My experience working with Serendipity &amp  Co. Inc.  has allowed me to fully acknowledge my passion for wedding planning. </p>
		<p>Every wedding becomes personal and special to me. I have become extremely passionate for every wedding I have been a part of. My personality truly encompasses the world of event coordination; I enjoy the thrill, busy nights and the new ways of learning the industry. Whether it's bringing the dreams and visions of brides to life, creating a special surprise party, celebrating the anniversary of love, or a fundraiser, I bring forth everything I have in making every event unique and special to my clients. </p>
		<p>As I like to say, “Your special day should be stress free and filled with joy and happiness.” I can ensure that every step with me will be guaranteed to be a smooth, momentous, and  memorable experience for you and your family</p>
